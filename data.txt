Come join the winners circle Put up your hands for me, baby And do it like we're supposed to 'Cause we're gonna win I got that disease ambition, success is the cure They wanna win, I gotta win, I sell the shit pure I got dopeboy bonds, Einstein brains The heart of a *** homicidal on the chain gang I want yachts and drops, I got spots to watch I wanna see what life is like from the mountain top Who says sky's the limit? I'm limitless, I just took the pill Why you think a *** slow flow so ill? Be careful, the shit I got is highly contagious We hustle 'til it had us all locked up in cages Time gon' fly when a *** been busy for ages War stories and wounds, back and forth, a *** been trading For the root of all evil, Lord said it's for Satan We from the bottom, desperation cause moves that we making I guess it's all risk versus rewards And a *** risk it all for the broads (What's up) Are you ready to win? Come join the winners circle Put up your hands for me, baby And do it like we're supposed to 'Cause we're gonna win Come join the winners circle Put up your hands for me, baby And do it like we're supposed to 'Cause we're gonna win"
